# C++ Learning-Journey

In this repository I want to show my progression and projects learning the low-level programming language C++.

## Purpose

The purpose of me learning C++, is to achieve a greater and deeper understanding of computers and how they work under the Hood. Later on I'm also planning to start getting into Competitive programming with enough knowledge and practice. Studying **Data structures** and **Algorithms** seems essential to me. Competitive programming is a huge section of programming with a lot of tasks and logic, but with enough practice everyone should be able to master these.

## Current Learning Plan
My current plan is now mastering the pure fundamentals of the C++ programming language, to gain active knowledge in its obscure syntax. For my learning progress i'll probably start with [@brocodez](https://youtube.com/@brocodez) **6 Hour** introduction course to **C++ programming** teaching the neccessary information to begin with. After completing the course and understanding the fundamentals such as `for loops`, `conditionals`, `functions` and `OOP`. Then is the point of learning the real cool stuff, with librarires such as **SDL3** and **OpenGL** and getting a good knowledge of **Network Programming** Learning critical and complex **math** and **physics**, formulas and functions to build *simulations*.
